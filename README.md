Jazz Jackrabbit 2 List Server: New Edition k. Run `j2lsnek.py` to start serving lists. Needs Python 3.

The "list server" is what Jazz Jackrabbit 2 multiplayer servers connect to to let people know they're live. Other people
connect to the list server to retrieve an up-to-date list of servers they can join. But if you're reading this you
probably knew that.

What's new
---
The aim of this application is to be more stable and resistant to attacks than the previous list server software. It
has as few dependencies as possible and should run with a minimal footprint. Another goal is to be easily extensible
with new functionality, should projects such as [JJ2+](https://jj2.plus) require it.

This list server adds a number of constraints that should make it better equipped to handle abuse than the original and
node.js-based list servers. It limits the amount of connections per IP, synchronises bans among mirrors and sanitises
server data. Managing bans and whitelistings is made easier via a remote admin interface (which is separate from this
repository).

Program logic
---
```
,-------------,                     ,-> Client connection handler 1
| Main thread |-+---> Port listener 1 +-> Client connection handler 2
`-------------` |                   `-> etc
       |        |
       |        `---> Port listener 2 ,-> Client connection handler 1
       |          `-> etc             `-> etc
       |
       `----> Message to remote list server 1
       |  `-> etc
       |
       `----> Listen for key input
```

All these are in separate threads. Each port has its own handler class, specified in a separate file, e.g.
`liveserver.py` contains the handler that processes clients sending data about their servers, on port 10054. These
handlers extend a basic handler class that can be found in `port_handler.py`.

The main thread can send messages to connected remote mirror list servers, and will create a new thread for each such
message sent (which terminates once it is sent). As the amount of data that needs synchronizing can grow high during
busy times this ensures everything will get through in a timely manner.

Server data is stored in an SQLite database; this data is removed once the server is delisted. A database is used so
data is persistent between threads and restarts and easy to manipulate in a standardised way.

Limited commandline interaction is available; the list server can be quit by entering "q", which will make sure that
all connections are closed properly before exiting. The server may also be commanded to pull the latest code from the
repository and restart itself via the API (see below).

APIs
---
ServerNet communication does not use Epic's binary protocol but a new JSON-based protocol. The advantage of this is that
server data can easily be serialised and synchronised between servers (and it's a lot easier to debug). There are no
separate commands for each updated property any more; rather, when a server's info changes, its changed data is broadcast
by the list server it is listed on, and other list servers replace their database records accordingly. Another new
feature is that bans, whitelistings and settings like the MOTD can also be synchronised.

ServerNet syncing treats all connected list servers as equal. This means all servers can add and remove items like bans;
origin does not matter, i.e. server A can remove a global ban set by server B. If this is a problem you should probably
be looking for more trustworthy list server hosts.

Remote administration is also available via the ServerNet API, though it uses a different port (10059 instead of 10056).
Connections on port 10059 need to come from localhost, so whatever interface you whip up needs to be on the same machine
as the list server itself. To ensure that only known interfaces can use the API, an SSL certificate is used for
authentication on port 10059. The important difference between commands to port 10056 and those to port 10059 is that in
the latter case the results will be synchronised between all mirrors and may originate outside ServerNet (i.e.
localhost), while commands on port 10056 are meant for the receiving server only and are only accepted when coming from
known mirrors.
